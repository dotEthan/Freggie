# Freggie Delivery
[http://www.freggie.ca](http://www.ethanstrauss.com/freggie)

I built Freggie to work as a food ordering portal for my healthy, food delivery start up. It worked very well and kept a nice record of all orders to ensure none were missed each day.

### Status

Finished. 

## Overview and Thoughts

### What Worked

The site looks and acts as I hoped.

### What Didn't Work

Definitely would prefer a more robust ordering form, but for what we needed it did the job.
